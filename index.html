<h1>My notes</h1>
<p>
I've learned a few things about web in this section - The web itself, What it is, How it looks like and how pieces fit together.
</p>
<em><h2>The Web</h2></em>
<p>The web is a collections of web documents made with HTML language connected through hyperlinks. 
It consists of <em>user, his computer w/browser, Internet </em>and <em>Servers</em>
<b>How it works?</b> You post a request that goes through your browser via Internet to servers 
<em>(through quite simple http ptotocol)</em>, and the server sends back files</p>
<em><h2>HTML</h2></em>
<p><em>HTML docs</em> are the hear of the web.
They consist of <em>text content, markup, references to other docs, link to thoer pages.</em> Markup is <em>made of tags</em>.</p>
<em><h2>Tags</h2></em>
<p>Tags can be of various types - mostly they have and opening and closing tag (Opening Tag+Content+Closing Tag=Element), 
though there can be void tags like 'br' which don't have a clisng one. There are also inline and block elements. I also got familiar with the general structure of the HTML document, which you can see implemented here.</p>
